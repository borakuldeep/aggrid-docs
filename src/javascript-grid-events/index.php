    <h2>Events</h2>


    <p>
        Below are listed all the events of the grid. Remember you can listen to events in
        the following ways:
    <p>

    <h4>
        <img src="/images/javascript.png" height="20"/>
        <img src="/images/angularjs.png" height="20px"/>
        Javascript and AngularJS 1.x
    </h4>
    <p>
        Add the relevant onXXX() method to the gridOptions or register a method
        via api.addEventListener(eventName, handler).
    </p>

    <note>For Angular 1 - ag-Grid does not not fire events inside an Angular JS digest cycle. This is done on purpose
        for performance reasons, as there are many events fired, even if you don't listen to them. Firing the digest
        cycle
        for each one would kill performance. So you may want to $scope.$apply() after you handle the event.
    </note>

    <h4>
        <img src="/images/react.png" height="20px"/>
        React
    </h4>
    <p>
        Add the relevant onXXX() method to the gridOptions or register a method
        via api.addEventListener(eventName, handler). You can also register events
        using React props in your JSX eg <i>eventName={this.myEventHandler.bind(this)}</i>.
    </p>

    <h4>
        <img src="/images/angular2.png" height="20px"/>
        Angular
    </h4>
    <p>
        Add the relevant onXXX() method to the gridOptions or register a method
        via api.addEventListener(eventName, handler). You can also register events
        using Angular event binding eg <i>(event-name)="myEventHandler"</i>.
    </p>

    <h4>
        <img src="/images/vue_large.png" height="20px"/>
        VueJS
    </h4>
    <p>
        Add the relevant onXXX() method to the gridOptions or register a method
        via api.addEventListener(eventName, handler). You can also register events
        using VueJS event binding eg <i>:event-name="myEventHandler"</i>.
    </p>

    <h4>
        <img src="/images/webComponents.png" height="20px"/>
        Web Components
    </h4>
    <p>
        Add the relevant onXXX() method to the gridOptions or register a method
        via api.addEventListener(eventName, handler). You can also register events
        by calling <i>domElement.addEventListener(eventName, handler)</i> or placing
        an onXXX method directly onto the dom element - but remember the latter
        uses lower case event name and handler name to be consistent with how other
        DOM elements work.
    </p>

    <h4>
        <img src="/images/aurelia.png" height="20px"/>
        Aurelia Components
    </h4>
    <p>
        Add the relevant onXXX() method to the gridOptions or register a method
        via api.addEventListener(eventName, handler). You can also register events
        by calling <i>domElement.addEventListener(eventName, handler)</i> or placing
        an onXXX method directly onto the dom element - but remember the latter
        uses lower case event name and handler name to be consistent with how other
        DOM elements work.
